# NUFS: A simple filesystem #

An implementation of a basic filesystem written using the
<a href=http://libfuse.github.io/doxygen/ target="_blank">FUSE API</a>
 
Languages and technologies used: 
- C (for all functional code)
- Make (used in Makefile)
- Perl (test script provided in assignment statement)
- Ubuntu 18.04 (for development/testing/compilation)

- **All code besides skeletons for several functions in 'nufs.c' was written by myself and my partner.**  
- **This project was an assignment for CS 3650: Computer Systems.  I strongly discourage plagiarism of this code as the course staff runs an automatic checker to all Bottlenose code, where this code was submitted, (and for the obvious reason that plagiarizing code goes against the Academic Integrity codes of Northeastern University).**

      
# Directions for launching filesystem: #

<ol>
 <li>Launch any version of Debian/Ubuntu (or any other local modern Linux).</li>
 <li>Install fuse and libfuse-dev packages.</li>
 <li>Make sure your working directory is a proper Linux filesystem, not a remote-mounted Windows or Mac directory.</li>
