# NUFS: A simple filesystem

An implementation of a basic filesystem written using the [FUSE API](http://libfuse.github.io/doxygen/).  
 
Languages and technologies used: 
- C (for all functional code)
- Make (used in Makefile)
- Perl (test script provided in assignment statement)
- Ubuntu 18.04 (for development/testing/compilation)

- **All code besides skeletons for several functions in 'nufs.c' was written by myself and my partner.**  
- **This project was an assignment for CS 3650: Computer Systems.**
